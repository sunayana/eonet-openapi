# eonet-openapi

This is an openapi specification of the [NASA's EONET](https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/what-is-eonet) API version [3.0](https://eonet.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/v3).

The Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET) is a prototype web service with the goal of:
 - Providing a curated source of continuously updated natural event metadata.
 - Providing a service that links those natural events to thematically-related web service-enabled image sources (e.g., via WMS, WMTS, etc.).

The yaml file in this repository has been written as per openapi specifications version 3.0 and [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) could be used to generate the required client in your
preferred language of choice.
